                <h4>My First Job as a Developer </h4>
                <hr>
                <p>My first job as a developer came just three months after I wrote my first "Hello World" code. When my boss assigned me a project, I was terrified. The pressure to prove myself, combined with the steep learning curve, was overwhelming. I was scared of making mistakes and not meeting expectations.</p>

                <p> However, that fear motivated me to work harder, learn quickly, and develop my problem-solving skills. </p>

                <p>Although it was intimidating at the time, that experience became a crucial turning point in my career, helping me build the confidence and resilience I have today.</p>

                <hr>
                <p>From reverse engineering to acquiring deep knowledge in Python full-stack development.</p>

                <p>Starting with a background in aeronautical engineering, I faced the daunting challenge of transitioning into IT. Joining CSC for computer science training was tough—I struggled to grasp the topics despite the notes provided. Realizing that documentation was just a reference, I took matters into my own hands, purchasing Udemy courses to build my knowledge. My journey didn't stop there; I enrolled in Apponix Academy, where I achieved 100% clarity in Python full-stack development. The road wasn't easy, but every challenge strengthened my resolve, transforming me into a proficient IT professional ready to conquer new horizons..</p>
